# Mixed Messages (*Codecademy Portfolio Project*)

As part of the Full-Stack Engineer course on Codecademy I was asked to create a message generator program. Each time a user runs the program they should get a randomised output made up of at least 3 different pieces of data.

I decided to create a program that motivates the user by providing them with an **inspirational quote**, a **nonsensical joke** and a **positive affirmation** to tell themselves.

## Project Objectives
* Build a message generator program using JavaScript
* Use Git Version control
* Use command line
* Develop locally on your computer

## Technologies
* JavaScript
* Node

## Setup
To run, download the .js file locally and run using node.js:
```
$ cd ../folder
$ node main.js
```
